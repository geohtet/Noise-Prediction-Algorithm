about=Noise Estimation From Point Source Algorithm British Standard - BS 5228-1:2009+A1:2014 Factors For consideration 1) the sound power outputs of processes and plant; 2) the periods of operation of processes and plant; 3) the distances from sources to receiver; 4) the presence of screening by barriers; 5) the reflection of sound; 6) soft ground attenuation. Other factors such as meteorological conditions (particularly wind speed and direction) and atmospheric absorption can also influence the level of noise received. The estimation of the effects of these factors is complicated, not least because of interaction between these factors, and is beyond the scope of this standard.
